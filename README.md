🌊 Pure-Flow
AI-Based Water Leak Detection & Quality Monitoring System

Pure-Flow is an AI-powered sustainability solution designed to detect water leaks and assess water quality in real time. The project focuses on reducing water wastage, improving water safety, and supporting UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) using responsible and explainable AI techniques.

📌 Problem Statement

Water distribution systems often suffer from undetected leaks and inconsistent water quality monitoring, leading to significant water wastage, infrastructure damage, and public health risks. Traditional monitoring methods are manual, reactive, and lack transparency. There is a need for an intelligent, automated, and explainable AI-based solution that can detect anomalies in water flow and classify water quality efficiently.

💡 Solution Overview

Pure-Flow analyzes water flow rate and quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, and chlorine levels using AI-driven logic. The system:

Detects abnormal water flow patterns indicating leaks

Classifies water quality into Safe, Warning, or Unsafe

Explains AI decisions using transparent reasoning

Provides actionable recommendations and alerts

The solution is designed as a conceptual prototype with dashboards, flowcharts, and AI workflows.
